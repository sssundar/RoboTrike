This TOC is split into two parts: what you'll see electronically,
and what I'll turn in. 

				Electronic Program TOC
Motors/TOC 
Code (.asm)					(unique to Motors/UI)
	UI-Motor board interface
		ML 					(Motors) 	addressing, CS, init, poll loop
		Handlers 			(Motors) 	process events, errors as they happen
										handle resolution of errors
		Parser 				(Motors) 	parse, execute commands
		SerialIO 			(Motors) 	interrupt-driven IO sans handshaking 
										except in SW for errors (see handlers)
										only difference from SerialIO_UI:
										PWMTimer can nest within Serial
										interrupt handlers.
		SerialCS 			(common) 	init for serial IO
	Core Functions
		Motors 				(Motors) 	calculate PWM duty cycles
		PIOSetup 			(Motors) 	parallel io chip-setup
		PWMTimer 			(Motors) 	200us timer interrupts
		.trigtbl (not included)
	Generic Functions
		queues 				(common) 	queue data structure and accessors
		converts 			(common) 	two useful numerical conversions
	Setup Functions
		IntSetup 			(common) 	base interrupt handler clearing
		ChipSel 			(common) 	base addressing for IO space

Constants (.inc, .asm)
	Base Addressing
		ML  				(common) 
	Generally Useful Constants
		GenConst 			(common)  	collected oft-used constants
		GenTimer 			(common) 	timer constants
		GenInts		 		(common) 	interrupt control register constants
	Consolidated Events and Errors
		Events 				(common) 	collected event ids, values		
		Errors.asm 			(common) 	collected error message strings
		Errors 				(common) 		and associated constants
	PWM Timer/PIO Constants
		PIOConst 			(Motors) 	parallel IO addressing constants
		HW4Timer 			(Motors) 	PWM timer constants
	SerialIO Constants
		SerialCS 			(common) 	serial setup, addressing, error bits
		Parser 				(Motors) 	parser state bits
	Oft-used buffers, queues...
		converts 			(common) 	conversion buffer data structure
		queues 				(common) 	queue buffer data structure

Assembly batch file
	assemble_hw9.bat

UI/TOC
Code (.asm)
	Motor/User UI board interface
		ML 					(UI) 		UI main-loop - different inits
		Handlers 			(UI) 		UI handler - includes KP mapping
		Parser 				(UI) 		UI parser - status, not commands
		SerialIO 			(UI) 		only difference: SerialPutChar 
		 								cannot be interrupted by Timer2
		SerialCS 			(common)		
	Core Functions		
		KPFuncs  			(UI) 		keypad functions untouched since
										homework 5 except for constant
										reorg
		DFiles  			(UI) 		scrolling display functions 
										untouched from hw4
										except for constant reorg
		TFiles 				(UI) 		timer functions untouched from hw4,5
										except for setting the DB-SlowRpt-Fast
										Rpt rates the same, and then changing
										Timer2 priority to priority7.
		.segtable (not included)
